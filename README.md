Written by yours truly, Go1den

## Installing:  
- Install Stylus (or other similar userstyles extension) on [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/) or [Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne?hl=en).  
- Download the css files from this project that match the website(s) you are using to watch the Olympics.  
- Click on the Stylus extension icon, then select "Manage" in the bottom left.  
- Click Import, then select the css file(s) you downloaded.  
- These should now show up in your managed files section. You can then open them individually to edit them further to your liking.

I recommend using both the Olympics.com css and the PeacockTV.com css userstyles I've provided. I like to browse the schedule on Olympics.com and when I find something I want to watch, I navigate to Peacock from within the Olympics.com site.
